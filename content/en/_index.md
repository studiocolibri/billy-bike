bike_description: "Billy bikes have been designed to offer optimal comfort in the streets of Brussels. Its wide saddle, large wheels and front suspension help to tame cobblestones and tram rails. With its large basket you can carry up to 20 kilos without affecting the direction and stability. And thanks to its electric assistance up to 25 km / h, you wonâ€™t feel the hills of Brussels."
