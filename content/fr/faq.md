## Riding Billy

### Where can I ride Billy?

Everywhere, as long as you bring it back in the Billy area.

### What is the Billy area?

On the map in the Billy app you can see a defined area. This is what we call the Billy area, only in this area you can pick up and drop off bikes.

### Can I ride a bike outside the Billy area?

Yes, as long if you bring it back inside the area when you’re done. You can always lock a bike outside the area but you cannot end your trip there, meaning you’ll continue paying for that time.

### Can I ride Billy at night?

Yes, Billy is available 24/7. Be careful though!

### Do I need a helmet?

It’s not required, but it’s always safer to ride with a helmet

### Can I bring it on a bus/tram/metro/train?

Well, you can, but you’ll break your back trying to carry it.

### How do I park the bike?

Attach the chain around a pole or bike rack. Press “Pause” or “End Rental” in the app, you’ll hear a little sound in the lock, push the orange slider to close the ringlock. You’re all done!

### How can I make sure the bike is locked correctly?

If the chain is correctly locked in the ringlock and the orange slider doesn’t move, it means it is securely closed. Also, be sure to wrap the chain around a solid object, be careful with thin fences for example, they are easy to cut through.

### Can I temporarily park my bike?

Yes, you can do this anywhere, inside or outside the Billy area. Remember that you will still be charged until you “End Rental”.

## Other

### What if I’m in an accident?

After calling the Police and/or Emergency services, immediately call team Billy. We’ll inform you with the following steps to take. Be sure to stay at the site of the accident.

### What if the bike breaks down/a tire pops?

End your trip and secure it to a pole, make sure to report any minor or significant damages to Team Billy within the app with the “Damage Report” or call us at +32-2-588-03-30 or send an email to team@billy.bike.

### What if the bike gets stolen during my reservation?

Immediately contact us. We will inform you that you need to file a complaint with the police and will guide you through following steps. (See section 3.4 of the Terms and Conditions)

### What if the bike is already damaged when I book it?

When you end your rental, the app will automatically ask you about the state of the bike. If the damage is minor you can use the bike if you wish to. If the damage is rather significant, try to find another bike.

### What if the bike runs out of battery?

This should not happen as we always pick up the batteries to charge when they reach 15%, which should allow you to still ride 5 km. If you still run out of battery, just lock the bike and end your ride. If you’re outside of the Billy area, give us a call on +32-2-588-03-30 or send us an email to team@billy.bike.
